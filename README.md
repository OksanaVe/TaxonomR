# TaxonomR: taxonomic decision support tool
## Overview  
TaxonomR is an interactive application designed to facilitate taxonomic ranking decisions and make them more transparent, explicit, and accessible to interpretation and comparison across alternative classifications. The program is developed using the Shiny package for R programming language and is available as an online application (https://oksanav.shinyapps.io/TaxonomR/). Source R script for the Shiny app is available in the [shiny_app files](https://github.com/OksanaVe/TaxonomR/tree/main/shiny_app%20files) directory.

## Input file requirements  
TaxonomR requires two input files: a tree file and a CSV data file. Examples of these files are provided on the project’s GitHub page: [Example tree file](https://github.com/OksanaVe/TaxonomR/blob/main/Example_tree.tre) and [Example data file](https://github.com/OksanaVe/TaxonomR/blob/main/Example_data.csv). 
(1) The tree file can be in nexus or newick format and should contain a single tree with branch lengths and support values (if two types of support values are present, TaxonomR will read the first value listed). Optional annotations such as node ages can also be included as in standard output tree files from MrBayes, BEAST, IQ-TREE and other commonly used phylogenetic inference programs (and are required to consider clade age in score calculation). Up to two tree files can be uploaded into the program if support values and divergence times are estimated separately. In this case, both files should include the same topology with the first tree file containing node support values and the second file containing a time-calibrated tree. It is important to note that TaxonomR is not a software for phylogenetic inference software and does not reconstruct topologies from data files; instead, it requires an input tree file produced by an external program for phylogenetic inference.   
(2) The data file is a CSV table that contains information about the groupings of taxa. For each proposed taxonomic group (e.g., genus, family, order), the following information should be provided in a single row under a column header with the following corresponding columns (note that all entries in the data file are case-sensitive):  
-	Group: name of a taxonomic group (e.g., genus name);  
-	Taxa: list of terminal taxa included in a group (e.g., list of species included in the genus). Taxon names should be spelled exactly as they appear in the tree file;  
-	Usage: this field includes information on the current usage of the proposed taxonomic group – it is scored as “new” for a newly proposed taxonomic group name, “new_use” for a previously used taxonomic name but with a modified taxonomic composition, “minor_use” for an existing but rarely used taxonomic name, and “major_use” when using a previously established and commonly used taxonomic name;  
-	Morph: this field indicates presence or absence of distinct morphological traits characterizing a proposed group. For operational convenience, this field is scored on a discrete scale with possible states defined as either “none” for the absence of distinguishing phenotypic traits (e.g., cryptic taxa that are genetically differentiated but are not morphologically distinguishable), “plastic”, if morphological features that characterize a taxon are plastic continuous traits such as colouration or highly plastic meristic and morphometric characters prone to homoplasy (e.g., number of gill rakers and body ratios in fish), “combo” for a unique combination of non-unique phenotypic traits (e.g., trout-perches of the genus Percopsis are characterized by the presence of an adipose fin, ctenoid scales, and fin spines; individually, these features are not unique to the group but together form a unique diagnostic combination), and “synap” for the presence of one or more unambiguous uniquely derived morphological traits that characterize a group.  
-	Age: this value specifies the divergence time for the proposed taxonomic group. A single value is entered in this column, which initiates an additional slider bar in the program interface where standard deviations can be indicated. The age value should be in the same units as the nodal age values in the tree file;  
-	Distribution: geographical range of the group. Distribution can be specified as a list of biogeographical realms, countries, regions, or areas in which members of the group occur. Range units should not include extensively overlapping or mutually inclusive regions (e.g., New World and South America); they can include areas of any scale, from provincial regions to countries and entire continents. Because defining distribution units can be highly subjective and variable across studies (Vences et al., 2013), the distribution division scheme should be clearly identified in the study.  
-	Ecology: ecological trait indicative of the group’s adaptive zone. It can include information on the diet, foraging habit, reproductive strategy, type of locomotion, nesting and migratory behaviour, host association or other traits that may be important in defining taxonomic groups. This criterion has to be scored as discrete traits and input into the information spreadsheet using short and descriptive keywords without any spaces, e.g. type of habitat can be scored as “woodlands”, “tall_grasslands”, “tropical_rainforest”, “tundra”, etc.  
-	Miscellaneous custom traits: current implementation of TaxonomR allows users to specify up to two additional traits in the “Misc_trait” columns of the data file. While the choice of traits is determined entirely by the user, it should be clearly defined in the study. Scoring and formatting of these traits are similar to that of “Ecology”.
Data fields for any column except Group and Taxa can be left blank if the information for a given criterion is not available or is not considered important.
